**What problem does this app address**

KEEN SF is a part of national, nonprofit organization that provides one-to-one-volunteer-led recreational opportunities for children and young adults with developmental delays or physical disabilities at no cost to their families and caregivers. KEEN’s mission is to foster the self-esteem, confidence, skills and talents of its athletes through non-competitive activities, allowing young people facing even the most significant challenges to meet their individual goals.

Currently KEEN relies on their website to register new participants and new volunteers as well as register approved volunteers for an upcoming session. All sessions are one-to-one so its is mandatory to pre-register and be mindful about cancellations. However it is hard to track attendance and athletes progress as coaches and participants cannot be easily check-in for the sessions on the spot. Additionally updating athlete and volunteer profile information is not streamlined at the moment. It requires entering the data by a staff member with appropriate profile access level. There is only one paid staff member and his/her time could be more effectively managed for outreach and program development instead of checking–in and entering data. Furthermore there is a critical need to get parents and volunteers more engaged and better informed about sessions, athlete’s progress feedback and upcoming events.

**How does this app will solve that problem**

The app should provide an easy and efficient way to check-in coaching volunteers and athletes/parents for a session as well as to update their profile information. Furthermore an app could help with sending SMS/email/push notification updates, reminders and info to parents and volunteers.
